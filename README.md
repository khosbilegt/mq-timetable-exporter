# MQ Timetable Exporter

A Chrome Extension that allows Macquarie University students to export their timetable from the Class Registration window in the student portal to iCalendar (.ics) format. Not uploading to the Chrome Web Store because it's for private use but feel free to clone, fork or download a version from the releases. Specifically for the URL: https://mq-edu.t1cloud.com/T1Default/CiAnywhere/Web/MQ-EDU/StudentTimetabling/StudentClassRegistrationMyMaintenance.

Confirmed working as of Session 1, 2026 on Desktop.

## How it looks

## Roadmap

1. Prepare .csv with Google Maps data of all building locations and embed links to them.
2. Handle bi-weekly and other weird complications.

## Context

Why spend 5 minutes doing a task when you can spend a couple hours automating it?
